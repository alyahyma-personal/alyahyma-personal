Hi 👋 My name is Mansour Alyahyay
=================================

Neuroscientist (PhD), Geophysicist (BSc).
-----------------------------------------

After three years in the oil industry, I pursued a PhD in neuroscience—diving deep into data analysis and visualization for over 8 years. I specialize in analyzing multimodal neural data and its relationship to animal behavior. But coding became more than just work—it became a hobby. Now I explore personal data projects that combine my interests: 
🏀 NBA Analytics – Predicting game outcomes and uncovering matchup-specific strategies 
📚 Book Discovery – Matching my reading history with Goodreads to find surprising recommendations 
🎼 Classical Music Patterns – Analyzing spatiotemporal structures to understand what makes composers unique
